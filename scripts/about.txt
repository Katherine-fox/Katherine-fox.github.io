Quick overview:
The site provides info and data on virtual currencies.

Pages description:
On the HOME page, you can list cards of existing currencies, filter the cards by their codes or by the toggled sign. You can review the basic info about a currency (press the "More info" button on a card of the selected currency). Besides that, you can select up to 5 currency cards to review live price data on the page "LIVE REPORTS" (please, use the toggle widget at the upright corner of cards)

The "LIVE REPORTS" page provides a chart of price data for toggled currencies (how to toggle currency see above in the HOME page section). The data have been updating in real-time each 2 sec.

The "ABOUT" page contains this info
